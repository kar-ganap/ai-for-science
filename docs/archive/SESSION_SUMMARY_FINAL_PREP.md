## Demo Strategy Recommendation

### Primary Strategy: Static Figures (SAFEST)

**Why:**
- Zero risk of code failure
- Focus on science and insights
- All figures pre-generated and tested
- Can walk through at own pace
- More time for Q&A

**Flow (5 minutes):**
1. Hook (30s): "Materials discovery costs money..."
2. Figure 1 (2 min): Walk through 4 panels
3. Figure 2 (1.5 min): Emphasize objective alignment
4. Close (30s): "62% efficiency, 25.1% improvement"
5. Q&A (remaining time)

### Backup Strategy: Quick Regeneration

**If asked "Can you show it works?":**
```bash
python run_hackathon_demo.py --quick
```
- Takes 14 seconds
- Shows all systems working
- Generates fresh figures
- Low risk

### Emergency Strategy: Full Pipeline

**Only if explicitly requested:**
```bash
python run_hackathon_demo.py
```
- Takes ~3 minutes
- Shows complete end-to-end workflow
- Higher risk of issues
- Use only if time permits and audience wants deep dive
