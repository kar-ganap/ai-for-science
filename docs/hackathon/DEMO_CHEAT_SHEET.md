| **18.6×** | Learning efficiency (exploration vs exploitation) | Figure 1, Impact close |
| **+26.6%** | Discovery improvement (AGD vs baseline) | Figure 2, Impact close |
| **2.6×** | Cost efficiency ($0.78 vs $2.03 per MOF) | Figure 1 Panel D |
| **100%** | Budget compliance + compositional diversity | Figure 1 Panel C, Figure 2 Panel C |
| **687** | CRAFTED dataset size (experimental MOFs) | Opening, Problem setup |
| **70-85%** | Portfolio constraint (% generated MOFs) | Architecture, Figure 2 Panel B |

## The Core Pitch (15 seconds)

> "**Tight coupling of Active Learning + Generative Discovery** for budget-constrained materials discovery. Not train → generate → select (sequential), but **iterative co-evolution**: AL guides validation, validated data trains VAE, VAE generates for next AL cycle. **Result: 18.6× better learning, +26.6% discovery improvement, 100% budget compliance.**"

**When to Use**: Opening (0:10-0:30), Closing (2:50-3:10), Q&A

## The 3 Key Innovations (Say These 3 Times!)

1. **GP Covariance for True Epistemic Uncertainty**
   - Not ensemble variance—true Bayesian uncertainty
   - Enables principled exploration (18.6× better than exploitation)

2. **Conditional VAE with Adaptive Targeting**
   - Target increases: 7.1 → 8.7 → 10.2 mol/kg
   - Learns from validation, generates increasingly ambitious candidates

3. **Portfolio Constraints (70-85% Generated)**
   - Prevents VAE overfitting
   - Balances innovation (generated) with validation (real)
   - Risk management like diversifying your portfolio

## Figure 1: The Money Shots

### Panel A (Top-Left): 4-Way Comparison
**POINT AT**: Green curve going down ✅ vs Red flatline ❌ vs Blue going up ⚠️
**SAY**: "Exploration: +9.3% reduction. Exploitation: +0.5%. Random: -1.5% (degrades!). **18.6× better.**"

### Panel D (Bottom-Right): Pareto Efficiency
**POINT AT**: Green in top-right (best), Red in middle, Blue in bottom-left (worst)
**SAY**: "Exploration: **$0.78/MOF**. Exploitation: **$2.03/MOF**—2.6× more expensive, 18.6× less effective."

## Figure 2: The Breakthrough

### Panel A (Top-Left): Discovery Progression
**POINT AT**: Orange climbing 📈 vs Gray flat 📉, R and G markers
**SAY**: "Baseline stuck at 8.75. AGD reaches **11.07 mol/kg (+26.6%)**. Pattern: **R → G → G**—Real MOF discovers 9.03, **Generated MOFs drive improvements**: 10.43 → 11.07."

### Panel C (Bottom-Left): Compositional Diversity
**POINT AT**: Orange/brown bars overlapping, blue line climbing
**SAY**: "**100% unique**—51 generated MOFs, zero duplicates. VAE target adapts: **7.1 → 8.7 → 10.2** mol/kg."

## Audience-Specific Emphasis

### Material Scientists
- **Say often**: "CRAFTED database", "$35-65/experiment", "100% budget compliance", "Deploy tomorrow"
- **Magic phrase**: "This is the regime YOU work in: 100 samples, tight budgets"

### ML Researchers
- **Say often**: "Tight coupling", "GP covariance", "Portfolio constraints", "Adaptive targeting"
- **Magic phrase**: "Not VAE OR AL—it's the tight coupling that enables breakthroughs"

### Non-Experts
- **Say often**: "Nobel Prize", "AI-designed materials", "26% better", "100% unique"
- **Magic phrase**: "Gray line stuck, orange line breakthrough"

## Judging Criteria Coverage (Check Before Demo!)

- [ ] **Scientific Relevance**: Mention "CRAFTED" (3×), "687 MOFs" (2×), "$35-65" (1×)
- [ ] **Novelty**: Say "tight coupling" (3×), explain 3 innovations, contrast with "sequential"
- [ ] **Impact**: Say "18.6×" (2×), "+26.6%" (2×), "transferable" (1×), "open-source" (1×)
- [ ] **Execution**: Show live regen, publication figures, mention "5 tabs", "documentation"

---

## Body Language Cues

- **0:10-0:30**: Interlock fingers when saying "tight coupling" / "iterative co-evolution"
- **1:20-2:05**: Trace green curve going down (good), point at red flatline (bad)
- **2:05-2:50**: Point at each R/G marker on Panel A, show contrast (baseline stuck vs AGD climbing)
- **2:50-3:10**: Look up from screen, make eye contact, confident tone

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **DON'T SAY**: "Our VAE generates MOFs" (sounds standard)
✅ **SAY**: "Tight coupling of AL and VAE—iterative co-evolution"

❌ **DON'T SAY**: "We use active learning" (sounds standard)
✅ **SAY**: "Budget-constrained AL with dual-cost optimization and portfolio constraints"

❌ **DON'T**: Focus on one plot panel
✅ **DO**: Connect all 4 panels—each tells part of the story

❌ **DON'T**: Use jargon without translation ("KL divergence", "covariance matrix")
✅ **DO**: Translate immediately ("KL divergence—that's the regularization term")

❌ **DON'T**: Forget baselines
✅ **DO**: Lead with comparison ("18.6× better than exploitation")

## Emergency Responses (If Demo Fails)

### Streamlit Won't Start
**BACKUP**: Have screenshot slideshow ready (save figures as PNG, open in Preview)
**SAY**: "Let me show you the pre-generated figures—these are from the last run"

### Regeneration Takes Too Long
**BACKUP**: Cancel and show pre-generated figures
**SAY**: "This usually takes 36 seconds, but let's jump to the results—you'll see the same outcome"

### Figures Look Broken
**BACKUP**: Have high-res PNG backups in `results/figures_backup/`
**SAY**: "Let me pull up the high-res versions"

---

## Q&A Quick Responses (30 seconds each)

### "How do you validate generated MOFs?"
**A**: "Demo: `target_co2 + noise` to prove AL loop. Production: plug in DFT (1-2 hours/MOF) or experiments. Framework is validation-agnostic."

### "Why GP instead of NN?"
**A**: "Small data—only 100 training samples. GPs excel here, provide true epistemic uncertainty. NNs need 1000+ samples. Framework is modular—swap if you have more data."

### "What if VAE generates invalid MOFs?"
**A**: "Two safeguards: physical constraints (positive dims, realistic ranges) + deduplication. Production would add DFT structure relaxation."

### "Can I use my own dataset?"
**A**: "Yes! Format: `[features, target, costs]`. System is dataset-agnostic. Open-source with documentation—README has 5-minute quickstart."

## Victory Conditions

### You CRUSHED It If Judges:
- Nod during architecture section (0:40-1:20) → Novelty resonates
- Write down "18.6×" and "+26.6%" → Impact quantified
