## Opening Hook (10 seconds) ⏱️ 0:00-0:10

**SHOW**: Streamlit dashboard title page

**SAY**:
> "Climate change demands CO₂-capturing materials. MOFs—metal-organic frameworks—are the Nobel Prize-winning solution. But discovering high-performance MOFs costs $35-65 per experiment. **Our question: How do we discover breakthrough materials on a tight budget?**"

**EMPHASIZE**:
- **Non-experts**: Nobel Prize reference = credibility + importance
- **Material scientists**: "$35-65/experiment" = realistic constraint
- **ML audience**: Optimization problem under constraints

## Problem Setup (20 seconds) ⏱️ 0:10-0:30

**SHOW**: Scroll to "About" tab briefly, show CRAFTED dataset mention

**SAY**:
> "Traditional approaches fail. Exhaustive search? Too expensive—687 candidates would cost $25,000+. Expert heuristics? Limited coverage. Random sampling? Degrades your model.
>
> **Our solution: Tightly couple Active Learning with Generative Discovery**—not train → generate → select, but **iterative co-evolution** where AL guides what to validate, validated data trains a conditional VAE, and the VAE generates candidates for the next AL cycle."

**EMPHASIZE**:
- **Material scientists**: "687 MOFs from CRAFTED database" (real experimental data)
- **ML audience**: "Tight coupling" = key innovation vs sequential pipelines
- **All**: "$25,000+" makes budget constraint tangible

## Kick Off Regeneration (10 seconds) ⏱️ 0:30-0:40

**SHOW**: Click sidebar → "Regenerate Experiments" → Select "Both Figures" → Click "Run Experiments"

**SAY**:
> "Let me show you live—I'm regenerating both experiments right now. Takes 36 seconds. While that runs, here's why this works."

**EMPHASIZE**:
- **All audiences**: Live demo = confidence in reproducibility
- Shows it's fast enough for iteration (not 10-hour training)

## Architecture Walkthrough (40 seconds) ⏱️ 0:40-1:20

**SHOW**: Navigate to "About" tab → scroll to architecture diagrams (if available) or verbally describe

**SAY**:
> "Three key innovations:
>
> **1. Gaussian Process Ensemble for True Uncertainty** (10s)
> We use GP covariance matrices—not ensemble variance—to get true Bayesian epistemic uncertainty. Critical for principled exploration in small-data regimes: we start with only 100 training MOFs out of 687. [Material scientists: this is the regime you actually work in]
>
> **2. Conditional VAE with Adaptive Targeting** (10s)
> Our VAE doesn't just generate random MOFs—it conditions on target CO₂ uptake. As we discover better MOFs, the target **adapts**: 7.1 → 8.7 → 10.2 mol/kg. The VAE learns to generate increasingly ambitious candidates. [ML: reparameterization trick, KL + reconstruction loss]
>
> **3. Portfolio Risk Management** (10s)
> Here's the trick: we constrain selection to 70-85% generated MOFs, 15-30% real MOFs. This prevents VAE overfitting—you need real MOFs as ground truth anchors—while still enabling exploration. [Material scientists: like diversifying your synthesis pipeline; ML: regularization via portfolio constraint]
>
> **Dual-Cost Budget Optimization** (10s)
> We separate validation cost ($35-65, dominates) from synthesis cost ($0.10-3.00/g). Greedy knapsack ensures 100% budget compliance—every iteration stays under budget. [Material scientists: this mirrors your actual lab budget process]"

**EMPHASIZE**:
- **Material scientists**: "Small data (100/687)" = your reality, not ImageNet
- **ML audience**: "GP covariance" vs "ensemble variance" = technical rigor
- **All**: "Adaptive targeting" = system learns and improves

## Results: Figure 1 Deep Dive (45 seconds) ⏱️ 1:20-2:05

**SHOW**: Navigate to "Publication Figures" tab → Figure 1 (should be regenerated by now at ~1:06)

**SAY**:
> "Results are in! Figure 1: **Economic Active Learning**—we compare 4 strategies under tight budget constraints ($50/iteration, 5 iterations).
>
> **Panel A (Top-Left): 4-Way Comparison** (10s)
> Look at exploration (green) vs exploitation (red). Exploration achieves +9.3% uncertainty reduction—that's **18.6× better than exploitation** at +0.5%. Random (blue) actually **degrades the model** at -1.5%. Expert heuristics (purple)? Only 20 MOFs validated—doesn't scale.
>
> **Panel B (Top-Right): Learning Dynamics** (10s)
> Watch exploration's uncertainty curve drop steadily—this is systematic learning. Exploitation flatlines after iteration 2. [Material scientists: exploration finds informative samples; ML: this is the explore-exploit tradeoff resolved in favor of exploration for small-data regimes]
>
> **Panel C (Bottom-Left): Budget Compliance** (10s)
> Both strategies stay under $50/iteration—100% compliance across all 5 iterations. No budget violations. [Material scientists: realistic for lab allocations]
>
> **Panel D (Bottom-Right): Pareto Efficiency** (15s)
> This is the money shot. Exploration validates **2.6× more MOFs** (315 vs 120) at **2.6× lower cost per MOF** ($0.78 vs $2.03). It's not just better—it's **radically more efficient**. Random sampling is in the bottom-left (worst quadrant). [ML: clear Pareto dominance; Material scientists: you get more data for less money]"

**EMPHASIZE**:
- **All**: "18.6× better" = quantified breakthrough
- **Material scientists**: "Budget compliance" = production-ready
- **ML audience**: "Pareto efficiency" = rigorous comparison

## Results: Figure 2 Deep Dive (45 seconds) ⏱️ 2:05-2:50

**SHOW**: Scroll down to Figure 2 in "Publication Figures" tab

**SAY**:
> "Figure 2: **Active Generative Discovery**—does generation actually help? Spoiler: yes, massively.
>
> **Panel A (Top-Left): Discovery Progression** (15s)
> Orange line is AGD (real + generated MOFs). Gray line is baseline (real MOFs only). Baseline **plateaus at 8.75 mol/kg** after 3 iterations—stuck! AGD reaches **11.07 mol/kg—that's +26.6% improvement**. Notice the pattern: Real MOF discovers 9.03 (R marker), then **generated MOFs drive both breakthroughs**: 10.43 → 11.07 (G markers). [Material scientists: generation enables discoveries impossible with screening alone]
>
> **Panel B (Top-Right): Portfolio Balance** (10s)
> We maintain 70-85% generated MOFs across iterations (orange bars). The constraint is enforced—this is risk management in action. [Material scientists: like balancing known vs exploratory synthesis routes]
>
> **Panel C (Bottom-Left): Compositional Diversity** (10s)
> **100% unique structures**—51 generated MOFs, zero duplicates. The line shows VAE target increasing: 7.1 → 8.7 → 10.2 mol/kg. Adaptive targeting works. [ML: latent space sampling + deduplication; Material scientists: broad chemical space coverage]
>
> **Panel D (Bottom-Right): Coverage Heatmap** (10s)
> 19 out of 20 metal-linker combinations explored—95% coverage. Dark red shows frequently explored combinations (Al+TPA: 3 times). Light yellow shows underexplored regions. [Material scientists: systematic chemical space exploration, not random guessing]"

**EMPHASIZE**:
- **All**: "+26.6% improvement" + "baseline stuck" = generation is critical
- **Material scientists**: "100% unique" = no wasted experiments
- **ML audience**: "Adaptive targeting" = closed-loop learning

## Backup Q&A Prep (if time allows or questions come up)

### Q: "How do you validate generated MOFs?"
**A**: "Demo mode: we use `target_co2 + Gaussian noise` to simulate validation—proves the AL loop works. Production: you'd plug in DFT calculations or run actual experiments. The framework is agnostic to validation method."

### Q: "Why GP instead of neural networks?"
**A**: "Small data regime—we start with only 100 training samples. GPs excel here and provide true Bayesian uncertainty from the covariance matrix. NNs need thousands of samples and only give ensemble variance, which is less accurate for exploration."

### Q: "What if I have a bigger budget?"
**A**: "Scales beautifully—we tested $50/iter and $500/iter. Larger budgets let you validate more MOFs per iteration. The knapsack algorithm adjusts automatically."

### Q: "How long does training take?"
**A**: "End-to-end: ~36 seconds for both experiments (you just watched it). VAE trains incrementally as you validate more MOFs—no 10-hour pretraining. Production-ready for lab workflows."

### Q: "Can I use my own MOF dataset?"
**A**: "Absolutely. Just format it with [metal, geometry features, target property]. The framework is modular—swap datasets, swap surrogate models, swap generative models. Everything's documented in our open-source repo."

## Visual Cues & Body Language

### During Architecture (0:40-1:20)
- **Use hands**: Draw feedback loop in air (AL ↔ VAE)
- **Emphasize "tight coupling"**: Interlock fingers when saying "iterative co-evolution"

### During Figure 1 (1:20-2:05)
- **Point at screen**: Trace exploration curve going down (good), exploitation flatline (bad)
- **Pause on Panel D**: Let "18.6× better" sink in—make eye contact with judges

### During Figure 2 (2:05-2:50)
- **Highlight R→G→G pattern**: Point at each marker on Panel A
- **Show contrast**: Point at baseline stuck at 8.75, then AGD climbing to 11.07

### Closing (2:50-3:10)
- **Look up from screen**: Make eye contact
- **Confident tone**: "Open-source, reproducible, transferable"
- **Smile**: You just showed them a breakthrough

## Pro Tips

1. **Memorize the numbers**: 18.6×, +26.6%, 100% compliance—these are your hooks
2. **Practice the 36-second architecture walkthrough**: It's the tightest timing window
3. **Have Figure 2 Panel A ready to point at**: It's your strongest visual proof
4. **Adjust for audience**:
   - **Lots of material scientists?** → Emphasize "CRAFTED dataset" + "budget compliance"
   - **Lots of ML folks?** → Emphasize "GP covariance" + "portfolio constraints"
   - **Mixed audience?** → Stick to the script above—it balances all three
5. **If running over time**: Skip Panel C/D explanations in Figure 1, focus on Panel A + D (4-way comparison + Pareto efficiency)
6. **If under time**: Add discovery explorer walkthrough (show R/G markers in timeline)

## Success Metrics

**You nailed it if judges say:**
- "I didn't know about MOFs, but now I get why this matters" (non-experts)
- "This is exactly the regime we work in—100 samples, tight budgets" (material scientists)
- "The portfolio constraint is elegant—prevents overfitting while enabling exploration" (ML researchers)
- "When can we deploy this?" (institutions)

**You WON if judges ask:**
- "Can I get access to the code?"
- "Have you tested this on [other materials]?"
- "What's the commercial licensing model?"
