## 🧪 **Pre-Demo Test Run**

**Morning of Hackathon (5 minutes):**

```bash
# Test 1: Environment check
uv run python --version
# Expected: Python 3.x

# Test 2: Quick VAE test
uv run python -c "
from src.generation.dual_conditional_vae import DualConditionalMOFGenerator
from pathlib import Path
vae = DualConditionalMOFGenerator(use_geom_features=False)
vae.load(Path('models/dual_conditional_mof_vae_compositional.pt'))
print('✓ VAE loaded successfully')
"
# Expected: ✓ VAE loaded successfully

# Test 3: Quick integration test
uv run python -c "
from src.integration.active_generative_discovery import ActiveGenerativeDiscovery
from pathlib import Path
agd = ActiveGenerativeDiscovery(
    vae_model_path=Path('models/dual_conditional_mof_vae_compositional.pt'),
    n_generate_per_iteration=10,
    temperature=4.0
)
print('✓ Active Generative Discovery initialized')
"
# Expected: ✓ Active Generative Discovery initialized

# Test 4: Full demo (optional - 2 min)
# uv run python demo_active_generative_discovery.py
# Expected: Completes without errors
```

## 📊 **Key Numbers to Memorize**

```
22%    - VAE diversity (up from 6.7%)
91.8%  - Novelty rate (generated MOFs not in DB)
60     - Unique MOFs per iteration
23/24  - Metal-linker combinations covered
1.2min - VAE training time
~2 sec - Generation time per iteration
```

---

## 🎬 **Demo Execution Plan**

### **Option A: Live Demo (if confident)**
```bash
# 1. Show VAE improvement (30 sec)
echo "Previous diversity: 6.7%"
echo "Current diversity: 22.0% (3.3× improvement)"
cat compositional_vae_training.log | grep "diversity"

# 2. Run full demo (3-4 min)
python demo_active_generative_discovery.py
# Let it run, narrate the workflow

# 3. Highlight results (1 min)
echo "Key results:"
echo "  - 187 total generated"
echo "  - 182 unique (97.3% diversity)"
echo "  - 167 novel (91.8% novelty)"
```

### **Option B: Narrated Walkthrough (safer)**
```bash
# 1. Show pre-run logs
cat active_generative_discovery_demo.log

# 2. Highlight key sections
# - Generation summary
# - Economic selection
# - Iteration progression

# 3. Show final results
cat results/active_generative_discovery_demo/demo_results.json
```

## 💡 **Talking Points Sequence**

**1. Problem Statement (30 sec)**
- "Economic AL optimizes MOF discovery efficiently"
- "But limited to 687 MOFs in database"
- "What if we could generate novel candidates?"

**2. Solution Overview (30 sec)**
- "Active Generative Discovery: VAE + AL tight coupling"
- "VAE generates new MOFs guided by AL's learning"
- "Not random - targets regions AL identifies as promising"

**3. Live Demo / Results (3 min)**
- "Watch: AL targets CO2=10.7 mol/kg region"
- "VAE generates 60 unique MOFs in 2 seconds"
- "55 are novel - not in database!"
- "Compete economically with real MOFs"
- "Iterate 3 times - targets evolve as AL learns"

**4. Key Results (1 min)**
- "22% diversity (3.3× improvement)"
- "91.8% novelty rate"
- "Infinite search space vs 687 constraint"

**5. Value Proposition (30 sec)**
- "Transforms AL from searcher to creator"
- "Economic awareness built-in (dual-conditioning)"
- "Framework works for any material property"

**6. Q&A Buffer (1-2 min)**
- Be ready for: "How do generated MOFs compete?" "Why tight coupling?" "What about duplicates?"

## 🚨 **Contingency Plans**

### **If Demo Crashes:**
1. **Immediate:** Show logs instead
   ```bash
   cat active_generative_discovery_demo.log
   ```

2. **Fallback:** Walk through saved results
   ```bash
   cat results/active_generative_discovery_demo/demo_results.json
   ```

3. **Last Resort:** Static presentation from summary doc
   ```bash
   cat ACTIVE_GENERATIVE_DISCOVERY_SUMMARY.md
   ```

### **If Questions Stump You:**
- "Great question! Let me pull up the details..."
  ```bash
  cat HACKATHON_QUICK_REFERENCE.md | grep -A 5 "Q:"
  ```

- Buy time: "The key insight here is the tight coupling between..."
