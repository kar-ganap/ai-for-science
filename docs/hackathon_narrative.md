# Hackathon Presentation Narrative
## Active Generative Discovery with Portfolio Constraints

**Time:** 12 hours to presentation
**Status:** âœ… Ready to present

---

## The Story in 3 Slides

### Slide 1: "The Problem"
**Title:** Materials Discovery is Expensive and Constrained

**Key Points:**
- Finding new CO2-capturing MOFs requires expensive lab validation ($35-65 per material)
- Budget constraints limit how many materials we can test
- Need to balance:
  - ðŸŽ¯ **Discovery** (finding best materials)
  - ðŸ“š **Learning** (improving our predictive model)

**Visual:** Show budget constraint graphic

### Slide 2: "Our Approach" â†’ **Show Figure 1**
**Title:** Foundation: Economic Active Learning

**Key Points:**
- Budget-constrained active learning on 687 real MOFs
- Acquisition function: `(performance + uncertainty) / cost`
- **Results:**
  - âœ“ 25% uncertainty reduction (learning)
  - âœ“ Budget compliance (100% within limits)
  - âœ“ Sample efficient (0.168%/$ improvement)

**Visual:** Figure 1 (4-panel ML ablation)

**Transition:** "But we're limited to 687 known MOFs. What if we could generate new ones?"

---

### Slide 3: "The Innovation" â†’ **Show Figure 2**
**Title:** Active Generative Discovery with Portfolio Constraints

**Key Points:**

#### The Approach
1. **VAE Generation:** Dual-conditional VAE generates novel MOFs
   - Conditions on target CO2 AND synthesis cost
   - Enforces 30% minimum compositional diversity
   - 100% novelty (not in database)

2. **Economic Competition:** Generated MOFs compete with real MOFs
   - Acquisition = `(prediction + uncertainty) / cost + exploration_bonus`
   - Exploration bonus: 2.0 â†’ 1.8 â†’ 1.62 (decays)

3. **Portfolio Constraints:** Balance exploration with hedge
   - Target: 70-85% generated, 15-30% real
   - Protects against VAE failure
   - Maintains validation of high-quality real MOFs

#### The Results
- **+42.7% discovery improvement** (7.76 â†’ 11.07 mol/kg)
- **19 unique metal-linker combinations** explored
- **100% compositional diversity** maintained
- **Portfolio balance: 72.7% generated** (within target)

**Visual:** Figure 2 (4-panel showing discovery, portfolio, quality, coverage)

## Key Technical Details (For Q&A)

### Question: "How do you justify the exploration bonus of 2.0?"

**Answer:**
- UCB1 theory suggests ~2.15 for our setting
- GP-UCB regret bounds suggest 4.0 (we're conservative at 2.0)
- Empirical analysis shows 0.05 sufficient, but 2.0 provides safety margin
- Decays over iterations (2.0 â†’ 1.8 â†’ 1.62) to shift exploration â†’ exploitation

### Question: "Why portfolio constraints?"

**Answer:**
Three reasons:
1. **Hedge against VAE failure:** If VAE generates poor MOFs, real MOFs provide safety net
2. **Model calibration:** Validating some real MOFs helps assess surrogate accuracy
3. **Risk management:** Don't put all eggs in one basket (generation strategy)

**Evidence:** In our demo, best MOF in iteration 1 was a real MOF (9.03 mol/kg). Without portfolio constraint, we would have missed it!

### Question: "What's the difference between validation cost and synthesis cost?"

**Answer:**
- **Validation cost ($35-65):** Lab cost to synthesize sample + measure CO2 uptake
  - This is what we optimize in AL (limited budget)
  - Metal-dependent (Ti: $58, Zn: $35, etc.)

- **Synthesis cost ($0.78/g):** Production cost per gram at scale
  - Used as VAE conditioning target (generate low-cost MOFs)
  - Not part of validation budget
  - Matters for eventual manufacturing, not discovery

### Question: "How did you fix the compositional diversity issue?"

**Answer:**
- **Problem:** VAE latent collapse â†’ only 6-9 unique compositions
- **Solution:** Post-generation diversity enforcement
  - Enforce minimum 30% unique (metal, linker) pairs
  - Accept new compositions first, then allow balanced duplicates
  - Result: 100% compositional diversity (18/18 unique in iteration 1)
- **Trade-off:** Generate fewer total candidates (18 vs 70), but much higher quality

### Question: "What acquisition function did you use?"

**Answer:**
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB): `mean + 1.96 Ã— std`
- NOT traditional Expected Improvement
- Works well because exploration bonus dominates selection anyway
- Simple to explain: "predicted value + uncertainty"

## Demo Flow (If Live Demo)

### Setup
```bash
cd /Users/kartikganapathi/Documents/Personal/random_projects/ai-for-science
uv run python demo_active_generative_discovery.py
```

### What to Highlight
1. **Diversity enforcement output:**
   ```
   Generating 100 MOF candidates with diversity enforcement:
     Minimum unique compositions: 30 (30%)
     âœ“ Generated 18 valid candidates
     âœ“ Unique (metal, linker): 18 (100.0% compositional diversity)
   ```

2. **Portfolio constraints satisfied:**
   ```
   Portfolio-Constrained Selection
     Target: 70-85% generated MOFs
     âœ“ Selected 12 MOFs for validation
       Real MOFs:      3 (25.0%)
       Generated MOFs: 9 (75.0%)
     âœ“ Portfolio constraint satisfied: 70% â‰¤ 75.0% â‰¤ 85%
   ```

3. **Discovery improvement:**
   ```
   Best MOF overall: 11.07 mol/kg
     Source: generated
     Metal: Ti
     Linker: trimesic acid

   Starting best: 7.76 mol/kg
   Improvement: +42.7%
   ```

## Budget & Cost Breakdown

### Total Validation Budget: $1,351 (across 3 iterations)
- Iteration 1: $465 (12 MOFs)
- Iteration 2: $464 (11 MOFs)
- Iteration 3: $422 (10 MOFs)

### What This Bought Us:
- 33 MOFs validated total
  - 24 generated MOFs (72.7%)
  - 9 real MOFs (27.3%)
- 19 unique metal-linker combinations explored
- Best performer: 11.07 mol/kg (Ti + trimesic acid)

### Per-MOF Cost:
- Average: $40.94 per MOF
- Range: $35-65 (metal-dependent)

## Limitations & Future Work

### Honest Acknowledgments:
1. **Small dataset:** 687 MOFs in database (CRAFTED subset)
2. **Simulated validation:** True CO2 values simulated with noise
3. **Synthesizability:** Filter disabled (needs tuning)
4. **Computational cost:** VAE sampling requires multiple attempts for diversity

### Future Directions:
1. **Improve VAE latent space:** Reduce mode collapse, increase native diversity
2. **Add synthesizability constraints:** Chemistry-aware generation
3. **Multi-objective optimization:** CO2 uptake AND stability AND cost
4. **Transfer to other materials:** Extend beyond MOFs (catalysts, battery materials, etc.)
