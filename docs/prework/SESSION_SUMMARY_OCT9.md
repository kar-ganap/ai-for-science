# Session Summary: October 9, 2025

**Duration:** ~2 hours
**Branch:** main
**Status:** ✅ Major milestone achieved - Visualizations complete!

---

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Clarified 4D Optimization Narrative ✅

**Issue:** Original plan had 4 objectives (Performance, Synthesizability, Cost, Time), but implementation diverged.

**Investigation:**
- Reviewed all planning docs (HARD version, Economic version, RECOMMENDED_APPROACH)
- Original plan: Performance, Synthesizability, Cost, Time
- Problem: Synthesizability meaningless (all CRAFTED MOFs already synthesized = 1.0)
- Problem: Time not useful in discovery phase (premature for production)

**Resolution:**
Created **four_dimensional_optimization.md** documenting the TRUE 4D framework:

1. **Performance** (CO2 uptake) - MAXIMIZE
2. **Synthesis Cost** ($/g production) - MINIMIZE
3. **Validation Cost** ($/MOF to test) - CONSTRAIN (budget)
4. **Uncertainty** (information gain) - TARGET (AL acquisition)

**Key insight:** This is actually MORE novel than original plan:
- Dual-cost framework (validation + synthesis) is unique
- All 4 dimensions are measurable and meaningful
- Grounded in reality, not theoretical proxies
- First AL system tracking both discovery AND production costs

**Future extensions noted:**
- Add synthesizability when using hypothetical MOF datasets (MOFX-DB)
- Add time for production-scale planning
- Both would be 5th and 6th dimensions

---

### 2. Built Complete Visualization Module ✅

**Created:** `src/visualization/economic_al_plots.py`

**Features:**
- Class-based design (EconomicALVisualizer)
- Publication-quality matplotlib plots (300 dpi)
- Modular methods for each plot type
- Automatic saving to `results/figures/`

**6 Plots Implemented:**

#### A. Cost Tracking Dashboard (4 subplots)
- Cumulative validation cost
- Budget compliance (iteration cost vs budget line)
- Average cost per MOF
- Cumulative MOFs validated

#### B. Uncertainty Reduction
- Mean uncertainty over iterations
- Max uncertainty in pool
- Shows 25.1% reduction (validates epistemic uncertainty)

#### C. Performance Discovery
- Best MOF performance per iteration
- Mean pool performance

#### D. Training Set Growth
- Training set size growth
- Pool size depletion

#### E. Summary Dashboard
- 3x3 grid with all metrics
- Summary statistics text box
- Single-page overview for presentation

#### F. Pareto Frontier ✅ (NEW!)
- All MOFs (gray scatter)
- Pareto optimal MOFs (red diamonds) - high performance, low cost
- Quadrant labels (target vs avoid regions)
- Can highlight AL-selected MOFs

---

### 3. Integrated Synthesis Costs into Dataset ✅

**Updated:** `tests/test_economic_al_crafted.py`

**Change:** Now saves MOF dataset with synthesis costs to:
`data/processed/crafted_mofs_co2_with_costs.csv`

**Columns added:**
- `synthesis_cost` ($/gram) - from cost estimator

**Result:**
- Pareto frontier plot now works automatically
- 687 MOFs with costs: $0.78-0.91/g (mean: $0.79/g)

---

## Current Status

### Results Summary

**From Integration Test:**
- 687 experimental MOFs loaded
- 3 AL iterations completed
- 188 MOFs validated
- $148.99 total cost
- 25.1% uncertainty reduction (validates epistemic uncertainty)
- 100% budget compliance

## What's Left

### For Hackathon Day:

1. **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard** (Optional - 1-2 hours)
   - Budget slider
   - Live AL iteration visualization
   - Interactive Pareto frontier
   - Cost breakdowns

2. **Presentation Prep** (30 min)
   - Review key talking points
   - Practice demo flow
   - Prepare Q&A responses

3. **Final Testing** (30 min)
   - Run end-to-end pipeline
   - Verify all plots generate
   - Test on fresh environment

---

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Multi-Constraint Optimization
**User Question:** "Can you remind me what are the axes of constraints we are using?"

**Answer:** 4 dimensions (corrected from original plan):
1. Performance (primary objective)
2. Synthesis Cost (production economics)
3. Validation Cost (discovery budget) ← NOVEL
4. Uncertainty (information gain) ← NECESSARY FOR AL

**Narrative:** Dual-cost, dual-objective optimization

### 2. Synthesizability & Time
**User Question:** "Is synthesizability realistic? Is time useful?"

**Analysis:**
- Synthesizability: Not useful with CRAFTED (all already synthesized)
- Time: Premature for discovery (matters for production)

**Decision:** Defer to future extensions:
- Add synthesizability when using hypothetical MOF datasets
- Add time for production-scale planning

## Next Session (Hackathon Day)

### Priority 1: Final Testing (30 min)
```bash
# Clean run of everything
uv run python tests/test_economic_al_crafted.py
uv run python src/visualization/economic_al_plots.py

# Verify all figures generated
ls -lh results/figures/
```

### Priority 2: Streamlit Dashboard (Optional, 1-2 hours)
```bash
# Create interactive demo
streamlit run src/visualization/dashboard.py

# Features:
- Budget slider
- Live AL iterations
- Interactive plots
- Cost breakdowns
```

### Priority 3: Presentation Prep (30 min)
- 5-minute script (already in WHERE_WE_ARE.md)
- Key talking points (4D optimization, dual-cost, 25% uncertainty reduction)
- Q&A responses (synthesizability, time, validation)

---

## Backup Plan

**If Streamlit dashboard doesn't work:**
- Use static plots (6 figures already generated)
- Walk through each figure manually
- Still have compelling story

**Minimum viable demo:**
- Summary dashboard (single overview)
- Pareto frontier (economic viability)
- Uncertainty reduction (validates approach)
- 3 figures = complete story

---

## Key Takeaways

### What Worked Well:
1. Clarifying the TRUE 4D optimization (more realistic than original)
2. Completing visualization module in one session
3. Documenting decisions for future reference
4. User's questions led to better narrative (synthesizability, time)

### What We Learned:
1. Original plan (synthesizability, time) wasn't grounded for CRAFTED
2. Dual-cost framework is MORE novel than original objectives
3. Quality over quantity: 687 experimental > 160K hypothetical
4. User's "can you remind me" question → comprehensive clarity

### For Hackathon:
1. Lead with 4D dual-cost narrative (unique)
2. Show uncertainty reduction (validates epistemic uncertainty)
3. Show Pareto frontier (economic viability)
4. Emphasize: "First budget-constrained AL for materials"
