# VAE Training Status

**Start Time:** October 9, 2025 ~11:19 PM
**Estimated Completion:** ~1:30 AM (1.75-2.5 hours)
**Background Process ID:** `0df1a2`

---

## Training Queue (6 Variants)

### Simple VAE (Composition + Cell Params Only)
1. **β=1.0** - ✅ In Progress (Epoch 40/100, Loss=6.91)
2. **β=3.0** - ⏳ Pending (~20 min each)
3. **β=5.0** - ⏳ Pending

### Hybrid VAE (+ 11 Geometric Features)
4. **β=1.0** - ⏳ Pending (~30 min each)
5. **β=3.0** - ⏳ Pending
6. **β=5.0** - ⏳ Pending

## Dataset Stats

- **Training samples:** 10,992 (augmented 16× from 687 original)
- **Metals:** Zn, Ca, Fe, Al, Ti, Unknown (6 types)
- **Linkers:** 4 types (BDC, BTC, NDC, BPDC)
- **Simple VAE features:** 14 (6 metals + 4 linkers + 4 cell params)
- **Hybrid VAE features:** 25 (14 simple + 11 geometric)

---

## Monitoring

### Live Progress
```bash
tail -f results/vae_training_log.txt
```

### Check Results
```bash
# When complete, results will be in:
ls -lh results/vae_evaluation/
```

Expected output files:
- `evaluation_summary_<timestamp>.json` - Metrics for all 6 variants
- `best_vae_<type>_beta<value>_<timestamp>.pt` - Best model checkpoint

---

## Evaluation Metrics

Each variant will be scored on:

1. **Reconstruction Accuracy** (%)
   - Metal prediction accuracy
   - Linker prediction accuracy
   - Combined score

2. **Cell Param RMSE**
   - Lower is better
   - Measures how well cell parameters are reconstructed

3. **Latent Coverage** (0-1)
   - Effective dimensionality of latent space
   - Higher means model uses latent space efficiently

4. **Generation Diversity** (%)
   - Unique (metal, linker) combinations in 1000 samples
   - Higher is better (more diverse candidates)

5. **Overall Score**
   ```
   Score = ReconAcc×100 + (1-CellRMSE)×10 + Diversity×50 - Loss×0.1
   ```

---

## Expected Results

### β Impact
- **β=1.0:** Balanced (good reconstruction + diversity)
- **β=3.0:** Regularized (smoother latent, may reduce overfitting)
- **β=5.0:** Heavy regularization (risk of under-reconstruction)

### Simple vs Hybrid
- **Simple:** Faster, fewer params (5K), lower overfitting risk
- **Hybrid:** Richer latent space, better generation quality (if augmentation sufficient)

**Hypothesis:** Simple VAE with β=1.0 or β=3.0 likely to win (safer with 10,992 samples)

---

## What Happens Next?

1. **Training completes** (~1:30 AM)
2. **Best model selected** (automatic via scoring)
3. **Integration with Economic AL**
   - Add generation step to AL loop
   - Generate candidates → Predict cost → Validate best
4. **Test end-to-end pipeline**
   - Start with 687 real MOFs
   - Generate 100 candidates via VAE
   - Run Economic AL to discover best performers

---

## Backup Plan

If training fails or takes too long:
- Use **Simple VAE β=1.0** only (already 40% trained)
- Skip comprehensive evaluation
- Proceed with integration

If results are poor:
- Fall back to **rule-based generation** (metal + linker combinations)
- Still have 687 real MOFs for Economic AL demo

---

**Status:** Training in background (stable, progressing normally)
**Next Check:** In 30 min (should be on Simple β=3.0 or finished with simple variants)
