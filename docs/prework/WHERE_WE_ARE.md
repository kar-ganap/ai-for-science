# Where We Are: Project Status Summary

**Last Updated:** October 8, 2025, 6:00 PM
**Status:** ~90% Complete (Prework Phase)

---

## üìç Current Position

**You are HERE:** Ready to build visualizations and finalize demo

**Progress:** Week 2 prework almost complete, ready for hackathon day

---

## üéØ The End Goal (What We're Building)

### **Project Name:** Economic Active Learning for MOF Discovery

### **The 30-Second Pitch:**
> "Post-Nobel, everyone will design MOFs. But can they afford to make them?
> Economic Active Learning finds high-performing MOFs that labs can actually
> afford to discover and produce. First budget-constrained active learning
> for materials discovery."

### **The Innovation:**
Traditional Active Learning asks: **"Which MOFs should I test?"**
Economic Active Learning asks: **"Which MOFs can I afford to test that will teach me the most?"**

### **The Demo (Hackathon Day):**
Interactive dashboard showing:
1. **Budget-constrained discovery:** $500 validation budget ‚Üí select ~10 MOFs/iteration
2. **Dual-cost tracking:** Validation cost (discovery) + Synthesis cost (production)
3. **Uncertainty reduction:** 25% decrease over 3 iterations (proves epistemic uncertainty)
4. **Pareto frontier:** High CO2 uptake + Low cost (economic viability)
5. **Real data:** 687 experimental MOFs from CRAFTED database

## üìö How We Got Here (Reverse Chronological)

### **MOST RECENT: Implementation Details** (Oct 8, 2025)

**`cost_framework_explained.md`** (Just created)
- **Why:** You asked: "Can we get realistic estimates for validation AND synthesis cost?"
- **Answer:**
  - Validation cost: $50/MOF (GCMC simulation)
  - Synthesis cost: $0.50-2.00/g (from reagent estimator)
- **Decision:** Implement dual-cost tracking
- **Status:** Documented, ready to implement

**`dataset_comparison_mofx_vs_crafted.md`** (Today)
- **Why:** You questioned if CoRE MOF 2024 was the right dataset (no CO2 data!)
- **Discovery:** CoRE MOF 2024 is structural only, no adsorption data
- **Solution:** Use CRAFTED (690 experimental MOFs with real CO2 isotherms)
- **Result:** Chose CRAFTED for quality over MOFX-DB quantity
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Downloaded, integrated, tested

**`uncertainty_quantification_explained.md`** (Today)
- **Why:** You asked: "How do we distinguish model uncertainty from true uncertainty?"
- **Core Question:** Does ensemble capture epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty?
- **Answer:**
  - ‚úÖ Captures epistemic (reducible, data sparsity)
  - ‚ùå Doesn't capture aleatoric (irreducible, noise)
  - ‚úÖ This is exactly what we want for Active Learning!
- **Validation:** Uncertainty decreased 25.1% over 3 AL iterations
- **Status:** ‚úÖ Documented and empirically validated

### **PLANNING PHASE: Strategic Decisions** (Oct 7-8, 2025)

**`RECOMMENDED_APPROACH.md`** (The Master Plan)
- **What:** Final recommended strategy for hackathon
- **Approach:** Economic Active Learning (Integrated)
- **Timeline:**
  - Week 1 (6 hrs): Cost Estimator ‚úÖ DONE
  - Week 2 (6 hrs): Economic AL Integration ‚úÖ DONE (mostly)
  - Hackathon Day (7 hrs): Visualizations + Demo + Present
- **Innovation:** "First budget-constrained AL for materials discovery"
- **Status:** Following this plan, on track

**`economic_active_learning_guide.md`** (Implementation Details)
- **What:** Complete code templates and implementation guide
- **Contents:**
  - Cost estimator code (‚úÖ implemented)
  - Economic AL selection (‚úÖ implemented)
  - Visualization templates (‚è≥ next step)
  - Presentation script (saved for hackathon day)
- **Status:** Used as reference during implementation

**`hard_vs_economic_comparison.md`** (The Decision Point)
- **Context:** You asked: "Is Economic AL sacrificing Active Learning?"
- **Concern:** Original HARD version had AL, new Economic version shouldn't lose it
- **Resolution:** "Economic Active Learning (Integrated)" - AL is CORE, economics added
- **Result:**
  - Keeps: Active Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Multi-objective
  - Adds: Budget constraints, Cost tracking, Economic viability
- **Status:** Implemented as "Economic AL (Integrated)"

**`competitive_analysis.md`** (Post-Nobel Strategy)
- **Context:** MOFs won 2024 Chemistry Nobel ‚Üí 50%+ teams will attempt MOFs
- **Question:** "How do we differentiate?"
- **Strategy:** Economic angle - "Everyone can design, we make it affordable"
- **Judge Psychology:**
  - ML judge: Impressed by AL + uncertainty quantification
  - Chemistry judge: Impressed by real cost analysis
  - Industry judge: **This is the winner** - commercial viability
- **Tagline:** "Everyone can design MOFs. Can you afford to make them?"
- **Status:** Core narrative established

**`nobel_pivot_strategy.md`** (The Pivot)
- **Context:** Nobel Prize announced, need to stand out
- **Original Plan:** HARD version (screening + AL, no economics)
- **Three Options Considered:**
  1. **Economic MOF** - Add cost/time objectives (RECOMMENDED)
  2. Diffusion Models - Generative MOFs (risky, 2 weeks prep)
  3. Foundation Model - Fine-tune MOFTransformer (ambitious)
- **Decision:** Option 1 (Economic MOF) ‚Üí became "Economic Active Learning"
- **Why:** Feasible prep time (15 hrs), novel angle, defensible
- **Status:** Executed, working

---

### **ORIGINAL PLANNING: Before Nobel** (Earlier)

**`solo_implementation_guide.md`** (HARD Version - Original)
- **What:** Original plan before Nobel Prize pivot
- **Approach:** "HARD" = screening + multi-objective + Active Learning
- **Objectives:** 3D optimization
  - Performance (CO2 uptake)
  - Synthesizability (can we make it?)
  - Confidence (1 / uncertainty)
- **Focus:** ML techniques showcase
- **Status:** Superseded by Economic AL, but kept as fallback

**`mof_project_tiers.md`** (Complexity Assessment)
- **What:** Baseline / HARD / Ambitious versions analyzed
- **Tiers:**
  - **BASELINE:** Screening only (6 hrs) - Too simple
  - **HARD:** Screening + AL + Multi-objective (7 hrs) - Original choice
  - **AMBITIOUS:** + Generative models (12 hrs) - Too risky
- **Decision:** HARD tier chosen, later evolved to Economic AL
- **Status:** Used for planning, HARD tier implemented with economic layer

## üö® Key Decisions Made

### **Data Decision:** CRAFTED over MOFX-DB
- **Why:** 690 experimental > 160K hypothetical
- **Reason:** Need real costs (can't cost hypothetical MOFs)
- **Trade-off:** Smaller pool, but higher quality
- **Verdict:** Quality over quantity for demo

### **Cost Decision:** Dual-cost framework (pending)
- **Validation cost:** $50/MOF (GCMC simulation)
- **Synthesis cost:** $0.50-2.00/g (production)
- **Why both:** More realistic, richer story
- **Status:** Documented, implementation next

### **Uncertainty Decision:** Ensemble-based
- **Approach:** 5 Random Forests with different seeds
- **Captures:** Epistemic uncertainty (data sparsity)
- **Doesn't capture:** Aleatoric uncertainty (inherent noise)
- **Verdict:** Appropriate for AL, validated empirically

### **Strategy Decision:** Economic AL (Integrated)
- **Original:** HARD (screening + AL + multi-objective)
- **Pivot:** Add economic constraints (post-Nobel)
- **Integration:** AL is CORE, economics is LAYER
- **Result:** Best of both worlds

## üé¨ The Narrative (5-Minute Presentation)

### **Opening (30 sec):**
> "The 2024 Chemistry Nobel recognized MOFs. Everyone will design them.
> But there's a gap: Can we afford to discover and produce what we design?"

### **Problem (30 sec):**
> "Traditional active learning ignores cost. Real labs have budgets.
> Real synthesis costs matter for commercialization."

### **Solution (45 sec):**
> "Economic Active Learning: First budget-constrained AL for materials.
> We optimize discovery cost (which to test) AND production cost (which to make).
> [Show dual-cost framework diagram]"

### **Demo (2 min):**
> [Interactive dashboard]
> "Started with 100 MOFs, $50 validation budget per iteration.
> Iteration 1: Selected 62 MOFs, spent $49.71, uncertainty = 0.122
> Iteration 2: Selected 63 MOFs, spent $49.52, uncertainty = 0.107
> Iteration 3: Selected 63 MOFs, spent $49.76, uncertainty = 0.091
>
> Uncertainty decreased 25% - proves our ensemble works.
> Budget constraints respected - proves economic AL works.
> Found high performers with low cost - proves practical value.
>
> [Show Pareto frontier]
> Not just best MOF - best AFFORDABLE MOF we can AFFORD TO DISCOVER."

### **Impact (30 sec):**
> "This framework enables:
> ‚Ä¢ Small labs with limited budgets
> ‚Ä¢ Industry commercialization planning
> ‚Ä¢ Post-Nobel scaling from design to production

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Questions & Answers

**Q: "Why only 690 MOFs? MOFX-DB has 160K."**
A: "Quality over quantity. 690 are experimental with real CO2 data and 12 methods for uncertainty. MOFX-DB is 92% hypothetical - can't estimate cost for structures that may not be synthesizable."

**Q: "How accurate are your cost estimates?"**
A: "Based on real reagent prices from Sigma-Aldrich. Validated on MOF-5, HKUST-1, UiO-66. Captures 60-80% of total synthesis cost (reagents dominate). Could extend with labor/equipment for full lifecycle cost."

**Q: "Is uncertainty reduction significant?"**
A: "25% reduction over 3 iterations with 188 MOFs validated. Comparable to published AL studies. More importantly: validates our ensemble captures epistemic uncertainty - the key for active learning."

**Q: "What about LLM synthesis routes?"**
A: "Originally planned (see nobel_pivot_strategy.md) but descoped for time. Current framework focuses on cost optimization. LLM routes would be next step for full synthesis planning."

**Q: "Can this scale?"**
A: "Absolutely. Validated on 687, can extend to MOFX-DB (160K) or hMOF (137K). Framework is modality-agnostic - could add GNN on structures, LLM on text. But we prioritized quality validation first."
