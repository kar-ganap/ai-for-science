# Four-Dimensional Optimization: The TRUE Story

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** FINAL - Use this for presentation

## Our 4D Optimization Framework

We optimize across **4 dimensions**, but NOT the originally planned ones. What we have is more realistic and novel.

### The Four Dimensions (Actual Implementation)

#### 1. **Performance** (Primary Objective)
- **Metric:** CO2 uptake (mol/kg) @ 1 bar, 298K
- **Goal:** MAXIMIZE
- **Role:** Primary objective - find best performers
- **Range:** 0-8 mol/kg in CRAFTED dataset

#### 2. **Synthesis Cost** (Production Economics)
- **Metric:** $/gram at production scale
- **Goal:** MINIMIZE
- **Role:** Commercial viability - "Can we afford to MAKE it at scale?"
- **Range:** $0.50-2.00/g in our dataset
- **Implementation:** Reagent-based cost estimator

#### 3. **Validation Cost** (Discovery Budget)
- **Metric:** $/MOF to test/validate
- **Goal:** RESPECT CONSTRAINT (hard budget)
- **Role:** Budget-constrained AL - "Can we afford to TEST it?"
- **Range:** $50/MOF (GCMC simulation) or $1500/MOF (experimental)
- **Implementation:** Budget constraint in economic selection

#### 4. **Uncertainty** (Information Gain)
- **Metric:** Ensemble standard deviation
- **Goal:** TARGET for learning (high uncertainty = high value)
- **Role:** Active learning acquisition - "What will we LEARN from testing it?"
- **Range:** Decreases over iterations (validates approach)
- **Implementation:** 5-model ensemble variance

## How They Interact (The Novel Part)

### Standard Active Learning:
```python
acquisition = uncertainty
# "Test the most uncertain MOF"
# Ignores: Can we afford to test? Can we afford to make?
```

### Our Economic Active Learning:
```python
acquisition = uncertainty / validation_cost
# "Test the most uncertain MOF per dollar spent"
# Respects: Discovery budget (validation cost)

# Then filter by:
pareto_frontier = high_performance AND low_synthesis_cost
# Ensures: Commercial viability (production cost)
```

### The Full 4D Picture:

**Discovery Phase (AL iterations):**
- Maximize `(information gain) / (validation cost)` → Budget-constrained learning
- Track cumulative validation cost → Stay within budget

**Production Phase (Final selection):**
- Pareto frontier: `(performance, synthesis cost)` → Economic viability
- Select: High CO2 uptake + Low production cost

**Result:** Best **affordable** MOF we can **afford to discover**

## Why This is Better Than Original Plan

### Original Plan (4 objectives):
1. Performance ✓
2. Synthesizability ❌
3. Cost ✓
4. Time ❌

### Problems with Original Plan:

**Synthesizability:**
- CRAFTED = 687 **experimental** MOFs (all already synthesized!)
- Synthesizability = 1.0 for every single one
- No discrimination possible
- Would need hypothetical MOFs to make this meaningful

**Time:**
- Discovery phase: All GCMC simulations are pre-computed (time = 0)
- Real experimental validation: 1-3 weeks regardless of MOF (similar timescales)
- Time WOULD matter in production (throughput, capital investment)
- But premature for discovery phase

### Our Actual Implementation (4 dimensions):
1. Performance ✓ (primary objective)
2. Synthesis Cost ✓ (production economics)
3. Validation Cost ✓ (discovery budget) **← NOVEL**
4. Uncertainty ✓ (information gain) **← NECESSARY FOR AL**

**Why this is better:**
- All 4 dimensions are measurable and meaningful
- Dual-cost framework is novel (no one else has this)
- Grounded in reality (not theoretical proxies)
- Actually differentiates candidates

---

## The Pitch: Dual-Cost, Dual-Objective Optimization

### Discovery Dimension (Active Learning):
- **Objective:** Maximize learning per dollar
- **Constraint:** Validation budget ($50/iteration)
- **Metrics:** Uncertainty reduction, budget compliance

### Production Dimension (Economic Viability):
- **Objective:** Maximize performance per dollar
- **Metric:** CO2 uptake / synthesis cost
- **Output:** Pareto frontier of high-performing, low-cost MOFs

### The Innovation:
> "First active learning system that optimizes BOTH discovery cost (which to test)
> AND production cost (which to make). Dual-cost framework for materials discovery."

## Visualizations (4D Space)

### Option 1: 3D Scatter + Color
```
X-axis: CO2 uptake (performance)
Y-axis: Synthesis cost (production)
Z-axis: Validation cost (discovery)
Color: Uncertainty (drives AL selection)
```

### Option 2: 2D Pareto + Subplots
```
Main plot: Performance vs Synthesis Cost (Pareto frontier)
Subplot 1: Validation cost per iteration (budget tracking)
Subplot 2: Uncertainty reduction over iterations (validates AL)
```

### Option 3: Interactive Dashboard
```
Slider: Validation budget per iteration
Output:
  - Selected MOFs (budget-constrained)
  - Pareto frontier (final candidates)
  - Cost breakdown (dual-cost tracking)
  - Uncertainty evolution (learning progress)
```

## Future Extensions

### When Using Hypothetical MOF Datasets (MOFX-DB, hMOF):

**Add Synthesizability as 5th dimension:**
```python
# Binary classifier
synthesizability = P(MOF can be synthesized)

# Training data:
positive_class = experimental_MOFs  # CRAFTED, CoRE (known synthesizable)
negative_class = hypothetical_MOFs_with_issues  # Unstable, unphysical

# Features:
features = [
    metal_linker_affinity,
    coordination_saturation,
    structural_stability,
    topology_rarity,
    density_range
]

# Filter:
candidates = pareto_frontier[synthesizability > 0.7]
```

**This makes sense ONLY for hypothetical MOFs because:**
- Need negative examples (unsynthesizable MOFs)
- CRAFTED = all synthesized already (no discrimination)
- Hypothetical datasets have ~90% that may never be synthesizable

### When Scaling to Production:

**Add Time Estimation as 6th dimension:**
```python
# From literature (parse synthesis procedures)
time_estimate = reaction_time + activation_time + workup_time

# Or heuristic proxy
time_estimate = f(
    max_temperature,  # Higher T → longer heating/cooling
    n_synthesis_steps,
    solvent_removal_difficulty,
    complexity
)

# Use for:
throughput_planning = reactor_capacity / synthesis_time
capital_investment = f(throughput, time_per_batch)
```

**This makes sense ONLY for production planning:**
- Discovery: Pre-computed simulations (time = 0) or similar timescales
- Production: Time → throughput → capital cost

## Key Messages for Presentation

### 1. "4D Optimization" (30 seconds)
> "We optimize across 4 dimensions: maximize performance, minimize production cost,
> respect discovery budget, and target high-uncertainty samples for learning.
> This is the first AL system with dual-cost tracking."

### 2. "Dual-Cost Framework" (45 seconds)
> "Traditional AL ignores cost. We track TWO costs:
> - Validation cost: Can we afford to TEST it? ($50/MOF simulation budget)
> - Synthesis cost: Can we afford to MAKE it? ($0.50-2.00/g production)
>
> This enables budget-constrained discovery AND economically viable selection."

### 3. "Why This Matters" (30 seconds)
> "Post-Nobel, MOF design is easy. But:
> - Labs have limited budgets → need validation cost awareness
> - Industry needs commercialization → need production cost optimization
> - We bridge the gap from design to deployment."

## Defense Against Questions

**Q: "Why not synthesizability?"**
> "CRAFTED contains 687 experimental MOFs - they've all been successfully synthesized.
> Synthesizability = 1.0 for every one, so it doesn't discriminate.
> If we extended to hypothetical MOFs (MOFX-DB's 160K), we'd add synthesizability
> as a 5th dimension. For now, we focus on dimensions that meaningfully differentiate."

**Q: "Why not time?"**
> "Time matters for production (throughput, capital investment), but we're in discovery.
> GCMC simulations are pre-computed, so validation time is negligible.
> When we scale to production, time becomes relevant - we'd add it as a 6th dimension
> for manufacturing optimization."

**Q: "Is 4D really novel?"**
> "What's novel isn't the number - it's the combination. No other AL system tracks:
> (1) Discovery cost AND production cost simultaneously
> (2) Budget constraints in sample selection
> (3) Economic viability in final ranking
> This is the first dual-cost framework for materials discovery."

**Q: "Can you extend this?"**
> "Absolutely. Our framework is modular:
> - Add synthesizability for hypothetical MOFs
> - Add time for production planning
> - Add selectivity for mixed-gas separation
> - Add stability for long-term deployment
> Each dimension plugs into the same Pareto optimization."
