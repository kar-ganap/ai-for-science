# Unified Hackathon Concept: Active Inverse Design with Multi-Objective Constraints

## 🎯 Core Idea: "AI Materials Discovery with Reality Checks"

Combine generative AI (inverse design), active learning (uncertainty awareness), and multi-objective optimization (real-world constraints) into a single, interactive discovery loop.

---

## The Integration

### **The Pipeline:**

```
User Input (Target Properties)
    ↓
[Generative Model] ← Inverse Design (#8)
    ↓
Candidate Structures (1000s)
    ↓
[Multi-Objective Scoring] ← Multi-Objective (#5)
  • Performance (CO₂ uptake / ionic conductivity)
  • Synthesizability
  • Model Confidence ← Active Learning (#2)
    ↓
Pareto Frontier (trade-offs visualized)
    ↓
[Uncertainty-Guided Refinement] ← Active Learning (#2)
  • High uncertainty → request "oracle" validation
  • Update models with new data
    ↓
Loop back: Generate next batch with refined understanding
```

### **What Makes This Special:**

Instead of just generating materials OR optimizing trade-offs OR doing active learning, you:
1. **Generate** candidates for user-specified properties (inverse design)
2. **Score** them on multiple objectives including uncertainty (multi-objective + active learning)
3. **Refine** the search iteratively by validating uncertain predictions (active learning loop)
4. **Visualize** the evolution of the Pareto frontier as AI becomes more confident

## Technical Implementation (6-7 Hour Timeline)

### **Hour 1: Setup & Data**
- Download pre-trained CDVAE (or DiffCSP) for structure generation
- Download pre-trained M3GNet/CHGNet for property prediction
- Prepare dataset: Materials Project for batteries OR CoRE MOF for carbon capture
- Load synthesizability database (SynMOF for MOFs or formation energy data for batteries)

### **Hour 2-3: Build Core Components**

**Component A: Inverse Design Engine**
```python
# Conditional generation from target properties
def generate_candidates(target_properties, num_samples=1000):
    # Use CDVAE conditional sampling
    # Target: ionic conductivity > 10^-3 S/cm (battery)
    #     OR: CO2 uptake > 8 mmol/g (MOF)
    return structures
```

**Component B: Multi-Objective Scorer**
```python
def score_candidates(structures):
    # Objective 1: Performance
    performance = property_predictor(structures)  # M3GNet/GNN

    # Objective 2: Synthesizability
    synthesizability = synthesis_model(structures)  # ML classifier

    # Objective 3: Confidence (NEW!)
    uncertainty = ensemble_disagreement(structures)  # Ensemble or dropout
    # Low uncertainty = high confidence

    return performance, synthesizability, confidence
```

**Component C: Active Learning Oracle**
```python
def oracle_validation(uncertain_structures):
    # In hackathon: use held-out validation set as "oracle"
    # In real world: would trigger DFT calculation or GCMC
    true_properties = validation_set.lookup(uncertain_structures)
    return true_properties

def update_models(new_data):
    # Fine-tune predictor on newly validated structures
    property_predictor.fine_tune(new_data)
```

### **Hour 4-5: Active Loop Implementation**

```python
for iteration in range(3-5):  # 3-5 AL iterations in hackathon
    # Step 1: Generate candidates
    candidates = generate_candidates(target_properties, num_samples=1000)

    # Step 2: Multi-objective scoring
    perf, synth, conf = score_candidates(candidates)

    # Step 3: Pareto frontier
    pareto_front = compute_pareto(perf, synth, conf)
    visualize_frontier(pareto_front, iteration)

    # Step 4: Active learning - select uncertain high-performers
    to_validate = select_for_validation(
        candidates,
        criteria="high_performance AND high_uncertainty",
        budget=50  # Validate 50 per iteration
    )

    # Step 5: Oracle validation
    true_labels = oracle_validation(to_validate)

    # Step 6: Update models
    update_models(to_validate, true_labels)

    # Step 7: Log metrics
    log_frontier_evolution(iteration, pareto_front)
    log_uncertainty_reduction(iteration)
```

### **Hour 6-7: Interactive Dashboard**

Build Streamlit/Gradio interface with:

**Panel 1: User Input**
- Sliders for target properties (conductivity, uptake, band gap, etc.)
- Chemistry constraints (elements to include/exclude)
- Budget (how many "oracle" validations to allow)

**Panel 2: Live Pareto Frontier**
- 3D plot: Performance vs. Synthesizability vs. Confidence
- Animate evolution across AL iterations
- Click points to see structures

**Panel 3: Uncertainty Map**
- Heatmap of chemical space showing where model is confident/uncertain
- Show how uncertainty reduces with active learning

**Panel 4: Discovery Metrics**
- Number of viable candidates (Pareto-optimal)
- Uncertainty reduction over time
- Validation efficiency (% of oracle calls that found good materials)

## Why This Stands Out

### **1. Addresses Real AI Challenges**
- **Hallucination:** Generative models can propose impossible structures → Multi-objective scoring filters these
- **Overconfidence:** Models may be wrong → Active learning quantifies uncertainty
- **Computation Cost:** DFT/GCMC is expensive → Active learning minimizes validations needed

### **2. Complete Discovery Workflow**
Most hackathon projects show ONE piece:
- Generate structures (but no validation)
- Predict properties (but no generation)
- Optimize (but in fixed design space)

This shows the **FULL LOOP**: Generate → Evaluate → Learn → Repeat

### **3. Interpretable & Interactive**
- User specifies what they want (inverse design)
- AI shows what's possible (Pareto frontier)
- AI admits what it doesn't know (uncertainty maps)
- User can steer the search (interactive)

### **4. Compelling Narrative Arc**

**Act 1:** "Here's what you asked for" (inverse design generates 1000s of candidates)
**Act 2:** "Here's the trade-offs" (multi-objective reveals conflicts)
**Act 3:** "Here's what we're unsure about" (active learning highlights gaps)
**Act 4:** "We learned and improved" (show frontier evolution after validation)

**Tagline:** *"AI that designs materials, understands trade-offs, and knows when to ask for help"*

### **5. Novelty**
- Active learning is common in molecular design, but **rare in materials**
- Multi-objective with uncertainty as an objective is **novel**
- Interactive inverse design with live AL loop is **unexplored**

## Computational Viability: ✅ **HIGHLY VIABLE**

### **Resource Breakdown:**

| Component | GPU-Hours | CPU-Hours | Risk |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Pre-trained CDVAE inference | 0 | 0.5 | ✅ Low |
| M3GNet/CHGNet inference | 0 | 1-2 | ✅ Low |
| Synthesizability classifier training | 1 | 0.5 | ✅ Low |
| Ensemble for uncertainty (5 models) | 0.5 | 1 | ✅ Low |
| AL loop (5 iterations × scoring) | 0.5 | 2 | ✅ Low |
| Fine-tuning on new data (per iteration) | 0.5 | 0.5 | ✅ Low |
| **TOTAL** | **2-3** | **5-6** | ✅ **Safe** |

### **Why It's Safe:**

1. **All models are pre-trained** (no training from scratch)
2. **Fine-tuning is fast** (only updating last layers on small batches)
3. **AL loop is parallelizable** (score all candidates at once)
4. **Graceful degradation:** If time runs out, can skip later AL iterations and still have complete demo

### **Fallback Options:**

If things break:
- **Skip fine-tuning:** Just use pre-trained models, show uncertainty but don't update
- **Skip generation:** Use existing database (Materials Project), focus on multi-objective + AL
- **Reduce iterations:** 1-2 AL loops still tells the story

## Audience Appeal: 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 (5/5)

### **For Non-Technical Audience:**
- ✅ "Tell AI what you want" is intuitive (inverse design)
- ✅ Trade-off visualization is universal (everyone gets Pareto curves)
- ✅ "AI knows what it doesn't know" is timely (AI safety/reliability narrative)

### **For ML Researchers:**
- ✅ Active learning methodology
- ✅ Uncertainty quantification (ensemble, Bayesian)
- ✅ Multi-objective optimization (novel objective: confidence)

### **For Materials Scientists:**
- ✅ Addresses synthesizability gap (major pain point)
- ✅ Shows complete workflow (not just toy demo)
- ✅ Quantifies when to trust predictions (practical)

### **For Judges (Khosla Ventures, etc.):**
- ✅ Scalable (this workflow applies beyond hackathon)
- ✅ Cost-aware (minimizes expensive validations)
- ✅ Practical (directly addresses deployment challenges)

## Differentiation from Other Teams

### **What others will likely do:**

| Approach | What's Missing |
|----------|----------------|
| Just generate structures | No validation, no constraints |
| Just predict properties | No generation, static design space |
| Just optimize existing materials | No exploration of new space |
| Use ChatGPT/LLMs for materials | Gimmicky, low accuracy |

### **What you'll do differently:**

✅ **Closed-loop:** Generation → Validation → Learning → Regeneration
✅ **Multi-objective:** Performance + Synthesizability + Confidence (3-way trade-off)
✅ **Interactive:** User steers, AI adapts in real-time
✅ **Transparent:** Shows uncertainty, doesn't pretend to know everything
